### Notes

## Bugs in Original Code
- Variable initialization: Only last variable in list is set to 0.
- Inefficient logic in `somaBit` and `somaCarryBit`.
- Redundant code (Always-true condition).

## Fixed Code
Corrected bugs, optimized functions, added English comments.

## Future Improvements
- Expand to 8-bit or 16-bit adder for larger numbers.
- Add subtraction or other arithmetic operations.
- Optimize code using bitwise operations for speed.
- Add input validation and error handling.
- Make code modular for reuse in other projects.
- Improve documentation with diagrams and examples.
